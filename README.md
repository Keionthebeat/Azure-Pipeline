2. **Azure Pipelines**
   - **What it does**: Azure Pipelines is like a robot that helps you check your work and make sure everything is correct before you show it to others. It has three main jobs:
     - PR Pipelines: These are like the robot's first check. It looks at your work before you share it with others to make sure there are no mistakes.
     - CI Pipelines: After you share your work, the robot checks it again, but this time it also makes sure everything works well together and creates a package of your work.
     - CD Pipelines: Finally, the robot helps you put your work out into the world and makes sure it works perfectly.
   - **Why it's important**: It helps catch mistakes early and makes sure everything works smoothly before anyone uses it. It's like having a super helpful robot friend who checks your homework.

3. **Azure Artifact Feeds**
   - **What it does**: Azure Artifact Feeds is like a library where you can keep all the special tools and parts (packages) you need for your IoT system. These packages can be things like software updates or new features.
   - **Why it's important**: It makes sure everyone on the team is using the same tools and parts, so everything works well together.

4. **Key Vault**
   - **What it does**: Key Vault is like a super secure safe, where you can keep all your secrets, like passwords and special keys that your IoT devices need to work.
   - **Why it's important**: It keeps all your important information safe from cyber criminals.

5. **Monitor**
   - **What it does**: Monitor is like a watchtower that keeps an eye on your IoT system. It collects information about how everything is working and can alert you if something goes wrong.
   - **Why it's important**: It helps you know if your system is working well or if there are any problems and will alert you.

6. **Application Insights**
   - **What it does**: Application Insights is like a detective that looks at how people are using your IoT system and how well it's performing. It gives you clues about what's working and what's not.
   - **Why it's important**: It helps you understand how to make your system better.

7. **Log Analytics**
   - **What it does**: Log Analytics is like a big filing cabinet where you can store all the logs (records) from your IoT devices. You can search through these logs to find out what happened at any time.
   - **Why it's important**: It helps you find and fix problems by looking at what happened in the past. It's like having a big filing cabinet where you can find any piece of information you need.
